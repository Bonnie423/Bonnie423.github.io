    <h3>
      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
      you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
      made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
    </h3>

    <p>
      In my previous role, we encountered a situation where we were working on a
      project, nearing the deadline. However, I discovered that the project's
      quality wasn't up to par for our clients. Unfortunately, we were running
      out of time to rectify the issue. It was a difficult moment for me as I
      had to decide whether to address the problem and delay the handover, or
      proceed on time with a project of subpar quality.<br />

      After carefully considering the advantages and disadvantages, I chose to
      communicate the true situation to the stakeholders. I convinced them to
      grant us a little more time to address the issue, aiming to deliver a
      project of high quality to our client. Initially, the stakeholders weren't
      very pleased with this decision, but their sentiment changed after
      receiving positive feedback from our satisfied client.<br />

      Looking back, I remain convinced that it was the right decision. Opting to
      prioritize long-term gains over short-term profit was a wise move. It
      demonstrates the value of making sacrifices for the sake of achieving
      lasting success.

      Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
      values and identity.

    <p>
      Growing up in a Chinese family and community, I value qualities like
      kindness, loyalty and persistent.<br />

      After I moved to NZ, New Zealand is known for its cultural diversity and
      acceptance of various backgrounds. Interacting with people from all over
      the world have broadened my understanding of different perspectives and
      value systems, allowing me to appreciate a wider range of beliefs and
      lifestyles.
