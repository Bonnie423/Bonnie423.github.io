        <h3>1. Were blocked on a simple problem:</h3>

        <p>When I was working on the 'gradebook' challenge, which required adding a 'testScores' property to each student in the gradebook, I encountered a problem. While testing my code, it just couldn't pass the test. I went through my code meticulously, used the DevTools for debugging, and even utilized console logs to inspect the output. However, I couldn't find any apparent issues with my code. At this point, frustration started to creep in.</p>
        <p>Then, I thought about common mistakes, and one thing that crossed my mind was spelling errors. I meticulously checked my code for spelling errors but found none. Despite my efforts, I was still stuck.</p>
        <p>Finally, I decided to read the requirements again. And there it wasâ€”I had missed a tiny detail. The requirement asked for a variable named 'testScores,' but I had used 'testScore.' It was such a small oversight, but it had a big impact on the outcome.</p>
        <p>I was quite frustrated because, after checking and using console logs, the problem was not with my code but with my understanding of the requirements. It was a valuable lesson learned. Just as it's crucial to understand stakeholders' demands in detail, it's equally important to read coding requirements meticulously to avoid wasting time on such non-coding issues in the future.</p>

        <h3>2. Elegantly solved a problem.</h3>
          <p>I once encountered a challenge while working on the 'FizzBuzz' problem. Initially, I couldn't quite grasp what the expected result of the code should be. It left me feeling puzzled.</p>

          <p>To tackle this, I decided to take a step back. I carefully reviewed the provided text and spent some time reading the test cases to gain a better understanding of the requirements. This deep dive into the problem made things much clearer.</p>
          
          <p>With a clearer understanding of the problem, I began researching relevant methods and techniques that could help me solve it effectively. Armed with this newfound knowledge, I applied these methods to my code. To my satisfaction, the problem was elegantly solved!</p>
          
          <p>Reflecting on this experience, it underscored the importance of Test-Driven Development (TDD). TDD not only aids in bug prevention but also plays a vital role in improving our understanding of code achievements. It's a valuable practice that benefits both developers and their teams. </p>
