    <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
<p>My goal is stepping in the IT job market after finished the course from Dev-academy.</p>
<h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning<h3>
<p>I am someone who values self-regulation. Once I make a decision to pursue something, I don't easily give up. I believe this trait will help me stay committed to my study journey, even if it becomes more challenging in the future.</p>
<p>My limitation about learning is that I am not a fast learner and I need my own time to process while learning in a group, which might be hard for me during bootcamp.
<h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
I would like to learn interview skills and communication skills while at Dev Academy.
<h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
I hope the bootcamp team can cover as more  details as possible during the course. And each student can have some one-to-one time to ask for help.
