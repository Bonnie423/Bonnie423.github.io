<h4>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>

<p>Emotional intelligence (otherwise known as emotional quotient or EQ) is the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathize with others, overcome challenges and defuse conflict.</p>
<br />
<p>Emotional intelligence is commonly defined by four attributes:
<br>
1.	<b>Self-management</b> – You're able to control impulsive feelings and behaviors, manage your emotions in healthy ways, take initiative, follow through on commitments, and adapt to changing circumstances.</br>
2.	<b>Self-awareness</b> – You recognize your own emotions and how they affect your thoughts and behaviour. You know your strengths and weaknesses and have self-confidence. .</br>
3.	<b>Social awareness </b>– You have empathy. You can understand the emotions, needs, and concerns of other people, pick up on emotional cues, feel comfortable socially, and recognize the power dynamics in a group or organization. .</br>
4.	<b>Relationship management </b>– You know how to develop and maintain good relationships, communicate clearly, inspire and influence others, work well in a team, and manage conflict. </br> </p>
<h4>How is EQ different to IQ?</h4>
<p>IQ (Intelligence Quotient) is a measure of your ability to solve problems and think logically.<br />
EQ (Emotional Intelligence Quotient) measures your ability to understand and manage emotions. <br />
“In other words, what matters is a different way of being smart.” -- Daniel Goleman</p>
<h4>Why is EQ important? </h4>
<p> Today, many organizations rely on EI and EQ to hire motivated, driven and empathetic employees. They’re not just looking for people with good grades. Instead, they focus on skills like empathy, communication and leadership. <br /> Having a high level of emotional intelligence allows you to empathize with others, communicate effectively, and be both self and socially aware. How we respond to ourselves and others impacts our home and work environments. Living in this world means interacting with many different types of people, as well as constant change and surprises. Being emotionally intelligent is key to how you respond to what life gives us. It’s also a key component of compassion and understanding the deeper reasons behind other people's actions.  <br /> EI is especially important when you are dealing with stressful situations like conflict, change, and obstacles. During these times, it's critical to remember to practice kindness, and being in touch with our emotions can help us do just that.  </p>
