    <h3>
      What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due
      to the core learning?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I have learned that take the time to listen to other people’s feelings and
      try to understand their situations. Also always seek for help when you
      needed, play as a team.
    </p>

    <h3>
      What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
      programming?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Values help us making decisions and seeking our goals. Empathy help us
      understanding other people’s situation and cooperate better together. And
      self-awareness helps us find our won way of learning.
    </p>

    <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
    <p>
      What surprised me was made me realize how important it is to take the time
      to listen to other people , and how important it is to be able to manage
      our emotion.
    </p>

    <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
    <p>Spending so much on writing this blog.</p>

    <h3>
      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
      focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </h3>
    <p>
      When we are seeking for jobs, people skills is as important as tech
      skills. So, it is part of the learning course
    </p>

    <h3>
      Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
      time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?
      Justify your answer.
    </h3>
    <p>
      At first, I did feel like it was a waste of time. But I think it will be
      useful in the real world.
