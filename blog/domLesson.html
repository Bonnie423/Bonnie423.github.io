<h4>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS </h3>
  <div class="relations">
  <p><b>HTML (HyperText Markup Language): </b>HTML is like the blueprint of the house. It defines the structure and layout of the house. It tells you where the rooms, doors, and windows should be. HTML creates the foundation and framework of your web page, just like a blueprint does for a house</p> 
  <p><b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): </b>Now, think about how you decorate the rooms in your house. CSS is like the interior design and decoration of the house. It determines the colors of the walls, the style of furniture, and how everything inside the house looks. CSS makes your web page visually appealing and stylish, similar to how interior design makes your house cozy and beautiful.</p>
  <p><b>JavaScript: </b>Imagine you want your house to have some special features, like lights that turn on automatically when you enter a room or a doorbell that plays your favorite song. JavaScript is like the electrical and automation system of your house. It adds functionality and interactivity to your web page. With JavaScript, you can make things happen when someone clicks a button, submits a form, or moves their mouse. It brings your web page to life, just like the electrical system makes your house convenient and functional.</p>

  <h4>Control flow and loops, arrays, and objects </h4>
  <div class="contrl-flow">
  <p><b>Control Flow: </b>Imagine you're following a recipe to bake cookies. You start at step 1, then move to step 2, and so on until you finish all the steps. This is similar to how a computer follows instructions in a specific order. Control flow is like the path you take through the recipe, ensuring that each instruction is executed in the right sequence.</p>
  
  <p><b>Loops:</b> Think of loops as a way to repeat a set of instructions without having to write them out over and over again. It's like when you're making paper airplanes, and you want to fold the same part of the paper multiple times. Instead of repeating the same fold instructions, you say something like, "Fold this part like this five times." That's a loop! It saves you time and effort by doing the same thing repeatedly.</p>
  
  <p> <b>Arrays: </b> Imagine you have a box, and you can put many things inside it. Each thing in the box has a number, starting from 0, 1, 2, and so on. You can easily take things out of the box by saying, "Give me the thing at position 2." Arrays are like these boxes where you can store a list of items (like numbers, words, or anything else) and access them using their position numbers.</p>
  
  <p> <b>Objects: </b> Think of objects as containers that can hold different types of things, like a backpack. In your backpack, you can have a pencil, a book, a snack, and more. Each thing has a name, like "pencil" or "book." Objects are like backpacks that can hold a bunch of items, and each item has a name and a value. It's a handy way to organize and store different pieces of information.</p>
</div>
  
  
  <h4>Functions and why they are useful</h4>
  <div class="functions">
  <p>Imagine you're making a sandwich:<br>
  When you make a sandwich, you often use different ingredients like bread, cheese, and vegetables. Now, let's say you want to make the same sandwich many times, maybe with a few variations, like adding or skipping some ingredients.<br>
  Here's where functions come in handy:<br>
  Functions are like a sandwich-making helper: <br>
  Instead of making each sandwich from scratch every time, you can have a helper (a function) who knows how to make a specific type of sandwich. You just tell your helper what kind of sandwich you want, and they do all the work for you.  It more efficiency, reusable and well organized, </p>
  
  <p> So, in everyday terms, functions are like your kitchen helpers that make it easy to do something repeatedly, efficiently, and with some flexibility. They're like mini-recipes for tasks you do often, and they make your life easier! </p>

  <h4> Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it. </h4>
  <div class="example-of-dom">
  <p> The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface provided by web browsers that represents web pages as a tree-like structure of objects, where each object corresponds to an element or part of a web page. It allows developers to interact with and manipulate the content, structure, and style of a web page using code.</p>
  <p> think of a web page like a document, just like a school assignment or a book. This document contains text, images, and various elements like headings, paragraphs, and links.</p>
  <p><b> The DOM: A Way to Interact with the Document: </b></p>
  <p> DOM provides a way to access and manipulate HTML elements on a web page using JavaScript, allowing you to create dynamic and interactive web applications.</p>
  <p> The DOM is like a special way to understand and interact with this document on a computer. It's a structured representation of the web page's content that web browsers create so that programmers (like website developers) can work with the document's elements and change them if needed.</p>
  <p><b> Example of Interacting with the DOM: </b></p>
  <p> Let's say you're reading an online article, and you want to make the text bigger for easier reading. Here's how you might interact with the DOM:</p>
  <p><b> Finding the Text Element: </b> You can use the DOM to find the part of the document that contains the article's text. It's like using a magic search tool for the web page. </p>
  <p><b> Changing the Text Size: </b> Once you've found the text element, you can tell the DOM to make the text bigger. It's like telling a friendly robot to grab a magnifying glass and make the text larger. </p>
  <p><b> Enjoying Easier Reading: </b> Now, the text on the web page appears bigger, and you can read it more comfortably, almost like you have a special pair of glasses for reading. </p>
  <p> So, interacting with the DOM is like having the power to change how a web page looks and behaves, just like adjusting the font size to make reading more enjoyable. It allows web developers to create dynamic and interactive websites where elements can be modified or updated without changing the entire web page. </p>
