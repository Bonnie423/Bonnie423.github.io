    What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?
  </h2>
  <h3>Relative Positioning</h3>
  <p>
    <b>Relative to Normal Flow:</b>Elements with relative positioning are
    positioned relative to their normal position in the document's flow. This
    means they still occupy space in the document flow, and nearby elements are
    not affected.<br />
    <b>Offset Properties:</b> You can use properties
    like<b>top</b>,<b>right</b>,<b>bottom</b>, and<b>left</b> to shift the
    element from its normal position.<br /><b>Example:</b>If you set position:
    relative; <b>top</b>: 20px;, the element will be moved 20 pixels down from
    its original position within the normal flow.
  </p>
  <h3>Absolute Positioning:</h3>
  <p>
    <b>Relative to Closest Positioned Ancestor:</b> Elements with absolute
    positioning are positioned relative to their closest positioned (non-static)
    ancestor. If no such ancestor exists, they are positioned relative to the
    initial containing block (usually the viewport). <br />
    <b>Taken Out of Normal Flow: </b>Elements with absolute positioning are
    taken out of the normal document flow, which means they do not affect the
    layout of nearby elements.<br />
    <b>Offset Properties:</b> You can use properties like<b> top</b
    >,<b>right</b>,<b>bottom</b>, and<b>left</b>to specify the exact position of
    the element relative to its ancestor.<br /><b>Example:</b> If you set
    position: absolute; <b>top</b>: 0;<b>left</b> : 0;, the element will be
    positioned at the top-left corner of its closest positioned ancestor.
  </p>
  <h3>Fixed Positioning:</h3>
  <p>
    <b>Relative to the Viewport:</b> Elements with fixed positioning are
    positioned relative to the viewport, which means they stay in the same
    position even when the page is scrolled.<br /><b>
      Taken Out of Normal Flow:</b
    >
    Like absolute positioning, elements with fixed positioning are taken out of
    the normal document flow.<br /><b> Offset Properties:</b> You can use<b>
      top</b
    >, <b>right</b>,<b>bottom</b> , and<b> left</b> to specify the exact
    position of the element relative to the viewport.<br />
    <b>Example:</b> If you set position: <b>fixed</b>;<b>top</b>:
    0;<b>right</b>: 0;, the element will be positioned at the top-right corner
    of the viewport and stay there while scrolling.
